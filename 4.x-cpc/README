DOCUMENTATION:

For the complete Long-Write-Up (TH/96-158) see
http://wwwcn.cern.ch/~jadach
and also comments in the source code, for example in the files: 
bhlp-4x/4.x-cpc/400/bhlum4.f, bhlumi.f, modl2a.f, modl2b.f
Postscript files for all relevant papers available from

HOW TO START TO USE THE PROGRAM?

The simplest thing you can do on the UNIX workstation is:
   > cd bhlp-4.x-cpc/4.x-cpc
   > make demo
On hp9000 or rs6000 installations the program should run immediately and it
will produce an output file bhlp-4.x-cpc/4.x-cpc/demo/demo.output 
and some plots bhlp-4.x-cpc/4.x-cpc/demo/demo.tex.
(The other platforms were tested for previous versions so in principle
there should not be any problems).
If LaTeX and xdvi are available then plots will pop up instanteniously on
your screen.
In this case you are executing the main program bhlp-4.x-cpc/4.x-cpc/demo.f.
This is an instructive example on how to set up input parameters
and run BHLUMI with variable/constant weights
or how to calculate the difference between  versions 2.01 and 4.x.
Moreover, the cross section printed in demo.output should be identical
(within statistical errors) with certain entries from the tables in the 
LEP2 workshop (1996) proceedings. 
See Long-Write-Up and comments in demo.f for more details.

With Latex/xdvi you may run immediately graphics demo-programs,
which will read archive histograms from our long runs, as follows:
(see below, 'Tips for non-IBM platforms' before runing!)
>   make arch-BeMaTabs-dvi	(1) CPC table  benchmark
>   make arch-BeMaFigs-dvi	(2) CPC figure benchmark
>   make arch-makfig1-dvi	(3) Z-contribution, th/95-74 plot
>   make arch-makfig2-dvi	(4) th/95-38 plots, Bhlumi-(Oldbis+Lumlog)
>   make arch-makfig4-dvi	(5) th/96-156 plots, Missing O(alf3)LL
>   make arch-Fig-MisO3-ps	(6) again th/96-156, Missing O(alf3)LL
>   make arch-makfig3-dvi	(7) exercise on dummy parameters in MC
This will show you pre-prepared plots based on stored (pre-generated)
results of the long MC runs.
The (1)-st and (2)-nd produce table and 2 figures in Long-Write-up.
These are benchmarks to be used to calibrate the program.
The (3) produces fig. 5 from CERN-TH/95-74 for Z contribution.
The (4) is plotting published comparisons Bhlum2-(Oldbis+Lumlog_h.o.)
for SICAL and OSiW detectors of paper CERN-TH/95-38.
However, some results from the actual program will differ from CERN-TH/95-38
plots due to bug 95a which was present in version 4.02
and is corrected here in the present version 4.04.
The (5) and (6) plots main results of CERN-TH/96-156 paper on missing
third order LL results.
And finally the (7) presents results of the exercise
on the independence of MC results on dummy parameters in the MC program.

IF YOU WANT TO RUN OUR EXAMPLE OF THE USER-PROGRAM FOR BHLUMI:

Then use the following commands:
   > cd bhlp-4.x-cpc/4.x-cpc
   > make prod2-start
This will execute link and  run demo2.f main program, histograms will
be stored on the disk in data-directory prod2.
Production can be stopped any time (after 1 hour?) with
   > make prod2-stop
resulting histos will be stored in bhlp-4.x-cpc/4.x-cpc/prod2
   > make prod2-dvi
will show samples of histograms from the run.

The same can be done for OLDBIS and LUMLOG:
   > make obis2-start
   > make obis2-stop
   > make obis2-dvi
and
   > make llog2-start
   > make llog2-stop
   > make llog2-dvi
Results from the above runs for statistics high enough can be used for
viewing benchmarks
   > make BeMaTabs-dvi
   > make BeMaFigs-dvi
and the reader can also reproduce by himself
all essential results (figures) from papers th/95-74, th/95-38
and th/96-156 with:
   > make makfig2-dvi
   > make makfig4-dvi
   > make Fig-MisO3-ps
These tests require very high statistics (10^9 events)
and we therefore included scripts fot running demo2.f on 
any typical computer farm.



RUNNING ON A FARM:

We have included execution scripts for running on
the SP-2, CSF, SHIFT, and BASTA farms.
For example in order to run demo2.f for multiphoton BHLUM4
on SP-2 in CERN 12 jobs in parallel:
   > cd prod2
   > make farm12-SP
   > make llsubmit12
even before jobs terminate you may view partial results with
   > make combine12
which adds histograms from all 12 jobs and
   > (cd ../figs; make prod2-dvi)
The very similar set of commands can be used to run OLDBIS and LUMLOG.


TOPOGRAPHY OF THE DIRECTORY:

bhlp-4.x-cpc/4.x-cpc     Main working directory with demo's
bhlp-4.x-cpc/400/        Monte Carlo event generator
bhlp-4.x-cpc/lib/        Tools for Monte Carlo and for histogramming
bhlp-4.x-cpc/dok/        documentation in postscript


TIPS FOR NON-IBM PLATFORMS

In some plotting routines in bhlp-4.x-cpc/4.x-cpc/figs double backslashes
has to be replaced with the single ones. 
Try the following:
>  cd bhlp-4.x-cpc/4.x-cpc/figs
>  make ibm-to-hp


Good luck!

                         Corrections Log
                       ===================


Version 4.04,  15 Sept. 1996.
****************************
    Many cosmetic corrections with respect to previous version 4.03.
    Some numerically insignificant errors in new LUMLOG are corrected.

Version 4.03,  30 March 1996.
****************************
    New total error estimate 0.11%, see Bhabha Working Group article
    in LEP2 workshop proceedings and the summary article in Phys. Lett.

    This version corresponds exactly to the ones used during the LEP2
    Workshop 1995 (Bhabha working group). The main difference with version 4.02
    is correction of the LL bug 95a. This correction was introduced in
    in July 1995 and all LEP2 WG  proceedings results are not affected
    by the bug. Many cosmetic corrections are also done.
    According to LEP2 WG conclusions the total theoretical error estimate 
    is something like 0.11-0.12%.

    The new LUMLOG with the final state bremsstrahlung and LL emulation
    of the BHLUM4 appears for the first time.
    This new LUMLOG is heavily exploited in TH/96-156 which calculates
    missing third-order LL in BHLUM4 to be negligible.


Version 4.02,  15 May 1995.
***************************

    New total error estimate 0.15%, see CERN-TH/95-38, (Phys.Lett.)

    Z-contribution according to CERN-TH/95-74 (to appear in P.L.) included.
    See routine 400/m2agzi.f and production directory 4.x-cpc/prod1.
    You may try 'make plot1' in 4.x-cpc/figs in order to reproduce Fig. 5
    in the paper CERN-TH/95-74.

    Vacuum polarization now available in THREE versions, 
    according to H. Burkhardt et.al. 1989 (as in BHLUMI 2.x)
    according to S. Eidelman, F. Jegerlehner, Z. Phys. C (1995)
    and according to Burkhardt and Pietrzyk, 1995 (Moriond).
    See description of KeyPia in the file bhlum4.f.

    Many small corrections suggested by users.

Done, there should be no " any more.

>> ...Events with wt=0 are cleaned (all 4-momenta set to 0) and 
>> ... divides by p2(3) and q2(3) which can definitely (may) be 0. 
Corrected by screening with additional 
    IF(wtcru1*wtcru2.NE.0d0) ... ENDIF

and also, 1 Dec 1994,
>> ....the logic in MERGIK assumes that the NPHOT1+1 and

OK. I agree that it is a bug. 
Sorry for confusion in the discussion in Dec.
Corrected REMPHO using patch from Delphi.

Alex Read, 29 Mar 1995, said:
>> You have a call to VESK2W with mode=1

Cured by adding harmless CALL VESK2W(1,...) just before.

Henryk Czyz, 6 May 1995, said:
>>   Mam nastepny problem z LUMLOG....ponizej pewnej granicy

      DO 40 I=1,NP
      THET=ANGFI(PP(3,I),DSQRT(PP(1,I)**2+PP(2,I)**2))
      IF (THET.GT.THMIN .AND. THET.LT.THMAX) THEN
The problem also mentioned by Alex read.
Corrected by adding in CLUSTE
      IF( (pp(3,i)**2+pp(1,i)**2+pp(2,i)**2) .GT. 0d0) THEN ! avoid 1/zero

Version 4.01,  21 Feb 1995.
***************************

(a) Incorrect implementation of vacuum polarization and s-channel gamma
    in routines modl2a and modl2b is now corrected.
    We are grateful to Frank Filthaut of L3 for pointing out to us this bug.
