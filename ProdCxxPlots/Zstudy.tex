 $\sqrt{s}=89.444$GeV.
 In columns 3-4 (VPold) BHLUMI 4.x is used for entries/raws 11-16 (1993-95) and 2 (updated OPAL).
 BHLUMI 2.x is used in raws 1, 3-5 (older data 1990-92).
 In case of BHLUMI 4.x VP is that of 1995,
 while for BHLUMI 2.x it is that of 1989.
 In columns 4-5 (VPnew) only BHLUMI 4.x with new VP of 2017 is used.
 Last column describes correction due to both change of VP 
 and change from 2.x to 4.x, if present (raws 1, 3-5).
